I’m going to link to the tutorials I’m following, but you can ignore those, since I detail every step I take.
Note: wherever I say "vim", you should probably use "nano".


Following http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/tutorials/emulate-a-bluetooth-keyboard-with-the-raspberry-pi
	Following http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup#Flashing_the_SD_Card_using_Windows
		Going to http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads
			Downloading latest Raspbian
				Kernel 3.10
				http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest
		Extracting raspbian zip file to hard disk
		Insert SD card into PC
		Downloading Win32DiskImager from http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
			Green download button
		Extracting Win32DiskImager
		Running Win32DiskImager
			Check if Device shows correct drive letter
			Opening raspbian image file downloaded earlier
			This dialog box is sloooooow
			Too impatient to wait
			Kill Win32DiskImager
		Running Win32DiskImager
		Fill in path to raspbian image by hand
		Write
			File doesn’t exist
		Correct drive letter to lowercase
		Write
			Yes, I’m sure I want to continue
			This is gonna take a while, so flip a coin to pick one of these links for distraction:

		Exit
		Safely remove SDcard
		Plug SDcard into RPi
	Plug HDMI cable into RPi
	Plug Powered USB Hub into RPi
	Plug keyboard into USB Hub
	Plug Bluetooth 4.0 adapter into USB Hub
	Plug power into RPi
	First boot
		Expand filesystem
		Enable boot/scratch
			Text console
				For now. We may need Desktop for Plover later, but it just makes things slow.
		Internationalization options
			Change Timezone
				Europe
				Amsterdam
		Change keyboard layout
			Generic 104-key PC
			Other
			English (US)
			English (US) - English (US, Colemak)
			Default alt-gr
			No compose key
			Don’t use ctrl+alt+backspace to terminate x-server
		Change user password
			Do this AFTER setting keyboard, or you may be typing other characters than you thought.
		Advanced options
			SSH
				Enable
		Finish
			Reboot now
	Boot into terminal
	Login
	sudo su
		You can ignore this LAN bit, it's just me making sure my Pi is recognized on the university network.
			ifconfig eth0 down hw ether [Mac address]&& ifconfig eth0 up
			plugin LAN
			Ping google.com
				success
			Stop ignoring things now.
		apt-get update
			Note: I’m not going to do apt-get upgrade after this, because that takes ages. Screw that.
		apt-get install vim python-gobject bluez bluez-tools bluez-firmware python-bluez python-dev python-pip bluez-utils bluez-compat bluetooth
			Note: I install more packages than the tutorial says here. Otherwise it didn’t seem to work for me.
				I’m installing bluez-utils, bluez-compat, and bluetooth. And vim, because I prefer vim over nano.
				Got inspiration from http://blog.kugelfish.com/2012/10/look-ma-no-wires-raspberry-pi-bluetooth.html
			It says it will take 167 MB
			Yes
			This is gonna take a while too, 15 minutes or so, so check out the other link now.

		pip install evdev
		vim /etc/bluetooth/main.conf
			Change line “#DisablePlugins = network,input”
			To "DisablePlugins = network,input,audio,pnat,sap,serial”
		/etc/init.d/bluetooth restart
		sdptool browse local
			Doesn’t show anything now besides “Browsing FF:FF:FF:00:00:00 …”, as it should.
		exit
	git clone https://github.com/Mqrius/BluePloverPi
	cd BluePloverPi
	sudo ./PiTooth.py
		Getting a bunch of timeouts, see if it still works though…
		Leave this running for now
	Alt+F2
		This goes to a second terminal screen
	login
	sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan
		Makes pi visible to scans
		Also timeout. Huh.
	Let’s try random stuff then.
		hcitool scan
			No results.
		Make android visible
		hcitool scan
			Oh it finds stuff now, but also my desktop PC, which it should have found a second ago too.
				Maybe it just needed some time to get the Bluetooth up and running?
		sudo hciconfig hci0 piscan
			Oh this works now!
			Let’s restart the PiTooth thing too then
		Alt+F1
		Ctrl+C
		sudo ./PiTooth.py
			Lookin’ good
		Alt+F2
		Back on track
	sudo bluetooth-agent 000000
		(The pin you write there is irrelevant, it generates a random one anyway)
		Scan with android
		click Raspberry Pi
		Confirm passkey
		We’re now connected
	Alt+F1
	On android, go to a text editor
	On the RPi, hit some buttons
		It works! :D :D
